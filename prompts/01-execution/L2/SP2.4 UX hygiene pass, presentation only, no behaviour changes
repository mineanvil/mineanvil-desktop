Cursor Task Brief — MineAnvil UX Hygiene Pass (SP2.4)

Context

MineAnvil is an Electron desktop app that has completed:

Layer 1 (Ownership & Launch Control)

Layer 2 (Deterministic Install, Rollback & Recovery)

All core behaviour is complete and validated.
This task is presentation-only.

Objective

Refactor the existing UI so that it feels like:

A calm, finished desktop app

Safe and trustworthy for parents

Simple and non-threatening for children

The UI must no longer resemble a Vite/React starter template.

Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

❌ Do not add or remove any behaviour

❌ Do not change control flow

❌ Do not introduce new state

❌ Do not auto-retry, auto-fix, or hide failures

❌ Do not introduce invite codes, Play flow, or Layer 3 concepts

This is UX hygiene only.

Allowed Changes

Replace framework branding with MineAnvil branding

Improve layout, spacing, typography, and hierarchy

Rewrite user-facing copy into plain English

Introduce clear visual “status cards”

Move technical fields (UUIDs, timestamps, flags) behind Diagnostics

Make Diagnostics explicitly opt-in

Improve loading and waiting presentation (cosmetic only)

UX Principles to Follow

Nothing should look breakable

Default view must be understandable by a non-technical parent

Child should see one clear, calm state

Errors must remain visible, honest, and readable

Deliverables

Updated UI components (React)

Updated copy strings

Before/after screenshots

Confirmation that no logic files were modified
