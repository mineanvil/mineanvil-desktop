# SP4.1 Placement Review: Home Screen Structure Analysis

**Status**: Validation Complete — Planning Document  
**Date**: Review completed  
**Purpose**: Validate placement of Curated World Example section on Home screen

---

## A. Placement Validation

### Recommended Placement

**Location**: Home screen, immediately below the Environment Status card, before the `status-grid` container.

**Structural Position**:
```
Home Screen Layout:
├── content-header (title + subtitle)
├── Environment Status card (full width, marginBottom: 1.5rem)
├── [SP4.1: Curated World Example] ← INSERT HERE
└── status-grid (Account + Launch sections)
```

**Code Location**: In `src/App.tsx`, within `renderHomeContent()`, after the Environment Status section closes (after line 182) and before the `status-grid` div (before line 184).

### Why This Placement is Safe

1. **Clear separation from actionable content**: The `status-grid` contains interactive sections (Account with sign-in/out, Launch with buttons). Placing SP4.1 outside the grid visually separates it from actionable controls.

2. **Maintains Environment Status primacy**: Environment Status remains the first and most prominent card. SP4.1 appears below it as secondary informational content, not competing for attention.

3. **Follows existing pattern**: The Environment Status card uses `marginBottom: '1.5rem'` to create spacing. SP4.1 can use the same spacing pattern, creating visual consistency without implying relationship.

4. **Prevents grid confusion**: If placed inside `status-grid`, SP4.1 would appear alongside Account and Launch sections, suggesting it's equally actionable. Outside the grid, it reads as informational.

5. **Desktop-first layout**: Full-width placement below Environment Status works well on desktop (primary use case) and doesn't break mobile layouts.

## B. Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Card styling suggests interactivity

**Risk**: The `status-card` class includes hover effects (`border-color` and `background-color` transitions). If SP4.1 uses the same card styling, parents may interpret the hover state as "clickable."

**Why it matters for parents**: Parents scanning the interface may see hover feedback and assume the world card is interactive, leading to confusion when clicking does nothing, or worse, frustration if they expect to install/use the world.

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Use a distinct CSS class (e.g., `info-card` or `example-card`) that removes hover effects
- Set `pointer-events: none` on the world card content (not the explanation toggle)
- Use a subtle visual distinction: slightly reduced opacity (0.95) or a different border style (dashed instead of solid)

### Risk 2: Visual similarity to marketplace/library patterns

**Risk**: A card displaying world information (name, description, tags) closely resembles marketplace listings, world libraries, or content feeds. Parents familiar with Minecraft marketplaces may assume this is a browsable catalogue.

**Why it matters for parents**: Parents may expect:
- Multiple worlds to scroll through
- Search or filter options
- "More worlds" or "Browse" links
- The ability to see additional examples

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Explicit section title: "Curated World Example" (singular, not plural)
- Single card only (no grid, no list, no scrolling)
- Clear visual framing: subtle background tint or border that differs from actionable cards
- Copy that explicitly states "example only" in the section title or immediately visible text

### Risk 3: Proximity to Launch section implies installation

**Risk**: If SP4.1 appears too close to the Launch Minecraft section (or if both are in the same visual group), parents may assume the example world can be launched or installed via the Launch section.

**Why it matters for parents**: Parents may try to use Launch controls to "activate" the example world, or may believe the world is already installed and ready to use.

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Maintain clear visual separation: SP4.1 is outside `status-grid`, Launch is inside
- Use spacing (1.5rem margin) to create a visual break
- Ensure the explanation text (collapsed by default) explicitly states "does not install or change anything"
- Consider a subtle visual separator (e.g., a thin horizontal rule or different background shade) between SP4.1 and the grid

### Risk 4: Tags suggest filtering or categorization

**Risk**: Displaying tags (e.g., "Exploration | Family-friendly | Adventure") may suggest the world is part of a filterable, searchable system. Parents may look for tag-based navigation or assume clicking tags will show similar worlds.

**Why it matters for parents**: Tags are commonly interactive in modern UIs (marketplaces, blogs, e-commerce). Parents may click tags expecting to see more content, leading to confusion when nothing happens.

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Display tags as plain text only (no links, no hover states)
- Use a separator that doesn't look clickable (e.g., "|" or "•" instead of styled buttons)
- Ensure tags have `pointer-events: none` or are wrapped in non-interactive elements
- Consider displaying tags in a muted color (e.g., `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`) to reduce visual emphasis

### Risk 5: World card layout resembles actionable items

**Risk**: If the world card uses a layout similar to Account or Launch cards (header, content, consistent padding), parents may assume it has actions available, even if no buttons are visible.

**Why it matters for parents**: Visual consistency with actionable cards creates expectation of action. Parents may look for buttons that don't exist, or assume the card itself is clickable.

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Use a visually distinct card style:
  - Slightly smaller padding (1rem instead of 1.5rem)
  - Different border style (dashed or thinner)
  - Muted background (e.g., `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03)` instead of `0.05`)
  - No hover effects
- Add a subtle visual indicator: a small "Example" badge or icon in the header
- Use typography to de-emphasize: slightly smaller title font size (1.1rem instead of 1.25rem)

### Risk 6: Explanation toggle pattern suggests configuration

**Risk**: The explanation toggle ("What is this?") uses the same pattern as Environment Status ("What does this mean?"). If parents see multiple toggles, they may assume SP4.1 has configurable options or settings behind the toggle.

**Why it matters for parents**: Parents may expand the explanation expecting to find installation options, world settings, or configuration choices, leading to disappointment or confusion.

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Keep explanation text minimal (maximum two sentences as specified)
- Explicitly state "example only" and "does not install or change anything" in the expanded content
- Use a distinct toggle label if needed (e.g., "What is this example?" instead of "What is this?") to emphasize it's informational
- Ensure the explanation panel has no interactive elements beyond the toggle itself

### Risk 7: Version compatibility text suggests technical action

**Risk**: Displaying "Works with Minecraft 1.20 and newer" may imply the world can be installed or that version checking/updating is required. Parents may assume they need to configure Minecraft versions to use the world.

**Why it matters for parents**: Technical information (version numbers) often appears alongside installation or configuration options. Parents may look for version selectors or assume the world requires specific setup.

**Mitigation without controls**:
- Frame version text as informational only: "Example world (compatible with Minecraft 1.20 and newer)"
- Use plain language: "Works with Minecraft 1.20 and newer" (already specified, good)
- Place version text in a muted, secondary position (not prominent)
- Avoid technical jargon or version-specific UI elements

## C. Visual Hierarchy Guidance (Text-Only)

### Relative Importance vs Environment Status

**SP4.1 must be visually secondary to Environment Status:**

1. **Size**: SP4.1 card should be the same width (full width) but can use slightly reduced visual weight:
   - Same padding is acceptable (1.5rem) for consistency
   - Slightly reduced background opacity (0.03 vs 0.05) to de-emphasize
   - No colored left border (Environment Status uses colored borders for safety signals)

2. **Typography**: 
   - Section title: Same font size (1.25rem) but slightly reduced opacity (0.85 vs 0.9) or weight (500 vs 600)
   - World card title: Smaller than safety-signal-title (1rem vs 1.1rem)

3. **Spacing**: 
   - Maintain 1.5rem margin below Environment Status (consistent spacing)
   - Add 1.5rem margin below SP4.1 before status-grid (creates clear separation)

4. **Visual emphasis**:
   - Environment Status uses colored left borders (green/yellow/red) for safety signals
   - SP4.1 should use a neutral, subtle border (no color coding)
   - Environment Status has hover effects; SP4.1 should not

### Relative Importance vs Escalation Content

**SP4.1 must not compete with escalation content:**

1. **Escalation content** (within Environment Status) appears when action is required. It uses:
   - Expanded panels with structured sections ("What happened", "What it means", "What to do next")
   - Clear visual hierarchy with labels and text
   - Prominent placement within the primary card

2. **SP4.1 positioning**:
   - Appears below Environment Status, so escalation content (if present) is always above it
   - SP4.1 is outside the Environment Status card, so it cannot visually compete with escalation panels
   - If escalation content is expanded, SP4.1 remains below and separate

3. **Visual weight**:
   - Escalation content uses structured panels with borders and backgrounds
   - SP4.1 world card should use a simpler, flatter design (no nested panels beyond the explanation toggle)
   - Escalation content has actionable guidance; SP4.1 is purely informational

### What SP4.1 Must NOT Visually Resemble

1. **Marketplace listings**: 
   - No grid of multiple items
   - No "Browse more" or "See all" links
   - No ratings, reviews, or popularity indicators
   - No price or purchase information
   - No "Featured" or "Recommended" badges

2. **Actionable cards** (Account, Launch):
   - No buttons or interactive controls
   - No hover effects that suggest clickability
   - No status indicators (success/warning icons)
   - No refresh or action buttons in header

3. **Configuration panels**:
   - No form inputs or selectors
   - No checkboxes or toggles (except the explanation toggle)
   - No "Save" or "Apply" buttons
   - No settings or preferences UI

4. **Content feeds or libraries**:
   - No scrolling lists
   - No pagination
   - No search or filter UI
   - No "Load more" or infinite scroll patterns

5. **Installation or download UI**:
   - No progress bars
   - No download buttons or links
   - No "Installing..." or "Downloading..." states
   - No file size or download speed indicators

## D. Final Placement Recommendation

### Authoritative Placement Specification

**Structural placement**:
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Function**: `renderHomeContent()`
- **Insertion point**: After the Environment Status section closes (after `</section>` at line 182), before the `status-grid` div (before line 184)

**Visual structure**:
```jsx
{/* Environment Status */}
<section className={`status-card ${safetySignalClass}`} style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
  {/* ... Environment Status content ... */}
</section>

{/* SP4.1: Curated World Example */}
<section className="info-card example-card" style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
  {/* ... SP4.1 content ... */}
</section>

<div className="status-grid">
  {/* Account and Launch sections */}
</div>
```

**CSS class requirements**:
- Use a new class: `info-card` or `example-card` (not `status-card`)
- Remove hover effects: `pointer-events: none` on world card content
- Reduced visual weight: background `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03)`, border `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`
- No colored left border (neutral border only)
- Slightly reduced title opacity: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)`

**Spacing requirements**:
- `marginBottom: '1.5rem'` on SP4.1 section (matches Environment Status spacing)
- Creates clear visual separation from `status-grid` below

**Content requirements**:
- Section title: "Curated World Example" (singular, not plural)
- Single world card only (no grid, no list)
- Explanation toggle: "What is this?" (collapsed by default)
- Explanation text: Must include "example only" and "does not install or change anything"
- Tags: Plain text only, muted color, no hover or click states

**Visual guardrails**:
1. World card content has `pointer-events: none` (explanation toggle remains interactive)
2. Tags use separator "|" in muted color (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`)
3. No hover effects on card or world content
4. Subtle visual distinction from `status-card` styling
5. Clear separation from `status-grid` (spacing + different container)

### Implementation Notes

When implementing SP4.1:
1. Create new CSS classes in `src/App.css`: `.info-card` or `.example-card` with the specifications above
2. Place the section in the exact location specified (after Environment Status, before status-grid)
3. Use hardcoded content (no data fetching, no state)
4. Reuse explanation toggle pattern from SP3.3 (same ARIA attributes, keyboard accessible)
5. Test that no hover effects appear on world card content
6. Verify spacing creates clear visual separation from actionable sections
