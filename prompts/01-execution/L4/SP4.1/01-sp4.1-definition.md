**Status**: Planning phase — NO IMPLEMENTATION

This document defines Stop Point 4.1 for Layer 4 — Content Expansion.

## Stop Point 4.1 — Curated World Entry

### Definition

A read-only, visibility-only "Curated World Example" section appears on the Home screen below the Environment Status card. This section displays a single static example world card that demonstrates what a curated world might look like, without any ability to install, download, activate, or use the world. The example is purely informational and explicitly marked as "example only" to prevent any confusion about functionality.

### Purpose

SP4.1 introduces parents to the concept of curated worlds through a single, static example. This is a visibility-only feature that:
- Shows what curated world information looks like
- Uses calm, parent-safe language
- Makes it clear the example is not functional
- Does not introduce any trust decisions or installation capabilities

### Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

SP4.1 is **read-only** and **visibility-only**. It must NOT:
- Download any content
- Install or activate any worlds
- Change Minecraft state
- Switch between worlds
- Mutate existing instances
- Introduce trust decisions for parents
- Provide child-facing UI
- Connect to a marketplace
- Include monetisation features
- Support mods or servers

### Key Decision (Locked)

The "world" is an **example only**. It does **not** come from anywhere in the product. It is:
- Not a world file
- Not a seed
- Not shareable
- Not runnable
- Not installable
- Not downloadable

If the example can be "used" in any way, SP4.1 fails.

## UI Section Contract

### Section Name
**"Curated World Example"** (singular)

### Location
Home screen, below Environment Status card

### Structure
- Section title: "Curated World Example"
- Single static world card (hardcoded, no data fetching)
- Collapsed explanation (default collapsed)
- No controls, buttons, links, or actions

### World Card Fields

The single example world card displays:
1. **Name**: A simple, descriptive world name (e.g., "Peaceful Valley")
2. **Description**: One sentence describing the world in calm, parent-safe language
3. **Version compatibility text**: Plain-language version requirement (e.g., "Works with Minecraft 1.20 and newer")
4. **Tags**: Up to 3 neutral, descriptive tags (e.g., "Exploration", "Family-friendly", "Adventure")

### Banned Elements

The world card must NOT include:
- Seed values
- Download buttons or links
- Author names or attribution
- Ratings or popularity metrics
- Dates (creation, update, etc.)
- Badges or achievement indicators
- Any buttons, links, or interactive elements
- Any actions that mutate state
- Screenshots or images (text-only)

### Explanation Pattern

The section includes a collapsed-by-default explanation (reusing SP3.3 pattern) that:
- Uses the same toggle pattern as "What does this mean?" from Environment Status
- Explicitly states: "This is an example only. It does not install or change anything."
- Uses calm, parent-safe language
- Contains no pressure, urgency, or teaching
- Maximum two sentences

## Notes for Implementation Phase

When SP4.1 moves to implementation:

1. **Location**: Add the section in `src/App.tsx` within the `renderHomeContent()` function, immediately after the Environment Status section.

2. **Styling**: Reuse existing card patterns from Environment Status. Add minimal CSS in `src/App.css` if needed, keeping it local and subtle.

3. **Explanation Toggle**: Reuse the exact pattern from SP3.3 (explanation toggle with chevron, ARIA attributes, keyboard accessible).

4. **Content**: Use the exact copy provided in this document. Do not deviate.

5. **Validation**: Test that no actions are possible, no state changes occur, and no backend calls are made when viewing the section.

**Document Status**: Planning complete. Ready for review before implementation.
