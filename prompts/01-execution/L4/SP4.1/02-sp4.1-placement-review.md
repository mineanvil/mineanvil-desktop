# Cursor Prompt — SP4.1 Validation: Home Screen Placement Review (NO IMPLEMENTATION)

You are working on the MineAnvil desktop app.

This task is **validation and planning only**.
Do **NOT** implement UI, components, styling, routes, state, IPC, backend changes, or data fetching.
Do **NOT** add buttons, links, hover effects, or actions.
Do **NOT** change behaviour.

## Authoritative governance (non-negotiable)

- The Stop Points Checklist is the scoreboard.
- Progress is real only when a stop point is checked off.
- Work must advance exactly ONE stop point at a time.
- Layer discipline is strict.
- UX principles:
  - Parent-first
  - Desktop-first
  - Calm, non-alarming
  - No jargon
  - Read-only unless explicitly stated
  - Explanations collapsed by default
- Technical discipline:
  - No new state sources
  - No backend or IPC changes
  - SafetySignal mapping logic is frozen
  - UI must not mutate behaviour

## Current active stop point

**Layer 4 — Stop Point 4.1: Curated World Example**

SP4.1 is planning-complete and defined as:
- A read-only, visibility-only section
- Showing a single example world
- No installation, activation, or interaction
- No implication of future availability or choice

## Purpose of THIS task

To **review the existing Home screen structure** and validate that adding the SP4.1 section:

1. Does not imply interaction
2. Does not compete with Environment Status
3. Does not look like a library, feed, or catalogue
4. Does not create expectation of action
5. Preserves the visibility vs control separation

This is a **conceptual placement and UX risk review**, not a build task.

## What you must do

1. Inspect the current Home screen layout and hierarchy.
2. Identify the correct visual placement for the section:
   - Relative position
   - Visual weight
   - Grouping with existing sections
3. Call out **any risks** where the placement could:
   - Suggest clicking
   - Suggest browsing
   - Suggest configuration
4. Propose **non-functional guardrails**, such as:
   - Spacing
   - Section framing
   - Copy cues
   - Visual de-emphasis

## What you must produce (deliverable)

Produce a **markdown review document** containing:

### A. Placement validation
- Where SP4.1 should appear
- Why this placement is safe

### B. Risk analysis
- At least 5 concrete UX risks
- Why each risk matters for parents
- How to avoid each risk **without adding controls**

### C. Visual hierarchy guidance (text-only)
- Relative importance vs Environment Status
- Relative importance vs escalation content
- What it must NOT visually resemble

### D. Final placement recommendation
A single, clear recommendation that can be used as the authoritative reference when implementation begins.
