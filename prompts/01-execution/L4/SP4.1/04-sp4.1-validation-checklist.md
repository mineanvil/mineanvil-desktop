**Verification Steps**:
1. Check `src/App.tsx`:
   - Verify only one new state: `worldExampleExpanded` (for explanation toggle)
   - Verify no new API calls or IPC messages
   - Verify no changes to existing functions or logic
2. Check `src/App.css`:
   - Verify new CSS classes: `.info-card`, `.info-card-title`, `.world-card-content`, etc.
   - Verify `.info-card` does NOT have hover effects
   - Verify `.world-card-content` has `pointer-events: none`
3. Check file structure:
   - Verify no new component files created
   - Verify no new route definitions
   - Verify section is inline in `renderHomeContent()`
4. Test existing functionality:
   - Verify Environment Status still works
   - Verify Account section still works
   - Verify Launch section still works
   - Verify navigation still works
   - Verify all existing buttons and actions function normally

### 6. UX Requirements

- [x] Copy is calm and parent-safe throughout
- [x] No pressure, urgency, or teaching language
- [x] No technical jargon
- [x] Section is clearly informational only
- [x] Visual weight is reduced compared to Environment Status
- [x] No hover effects on card or world content

**Verification Steps**:
1. Read all copy in the section:
   - Section title: "Curated World Example"
   - World name: "Peaceful Valley"
   - Description: "A gentle world designed for exploration and building, with safe terrain and friendly landscapes."
   - Version: "Works with Minecraft 1.20 and newer"
   - Tags: "Exploration | Family-friendly | Adventure"
   - Explanation: "This is an example only. It shows what curated worlds might look like in the future. It does not install or change anything in Minecraft."
2. Verify no pressure words (urgent, now, immediately, must, should)
3. Verify no teaching language (learn, understand, discover)
4. Verify no technical jargon (API, endpoint, configuration, etc.)
5. Visual inspection:
   - Verify card background is more transparent than status-card (0.03 vs 0.05)
   - Verify card border is more subtle (0.08 vs 0.1)
   - Verify title opacity is reduced (0.85 vs 0.9)
   - Verify no hover effects on card
   - Verify no hover effects on world content

- [x] Clear visual separation from actionable sections

**Verification Steps**:
1. Visual inspection of Home screen layout:
   - Verify order: Header → Environment Status → SP4.1 → Account/Launch grid
2. Measure spacing:
   - Verify 1.5rem margin below Environment Status
   - Verify 1.5rem margin below SP4.1
3. Verify visual separation:
   - SP4.1 is outside status-grid container
   - SP4.1 uses different CSS class (info-card vs status-card)
   - Clear visual break between SP4.1 and grid below

---

### 8. CSS Implementation

- [x] `.info-card` has no hover effects
- [x] `.world-card-content` has `pointer-events: none`
- [x] `.world-card-tags` uses muted color (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5))
- [x] `.info-card-title` has reduced opacity (0.85)

**Verification Steps**:
1. Inspect CSS in `src/App.css`:
   - Verify `.info-card` background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03)`
   - Verify `.info-card` border: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`
   - Verify `.info-card` has NO `:hover` pseudo-class
   - Verify `.world-card-content` has `pointer-events: none`
   - Verify `.world-card-tags` color: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`
   - Verify `.info-card-title` color: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)`
2. Test in browser:
   - Hover over card → verify no visual changes
   - Hover over world content → verify no visual changes
   - Click world content → verify no interaction
