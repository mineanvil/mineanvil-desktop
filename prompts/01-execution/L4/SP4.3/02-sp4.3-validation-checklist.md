# SP4.3 Validation Checklist

This document provides a validation checklist for Stop Point 4.3 — Guided World Creation (Parent-Initiated).

---

## Action Visibility

- [ ] "Create world" button appears next to each seed in "Curated World Seeds" section
- [ ] Button is clearly labeled and visible
- [ ] Button does not appear on Curated World Example section
- [ ] Button does not appear in menus or navigation
- [ ] Button styling is consistent with other seed actions

---

## Modal Confirmation Dialog

- [ ] Clicking "Create world" opens a confirmation dialog
- [ ] Dialog blocks interaction with the rest of the application until resolved
- [ ] Dialog displays seed value that will be used
- [ ] Dialog displays Minecraft version that will be used
- [ ] Dialog clearly states MineAnvil will open Minecraft
- [ ] Dialog clearly states MineAnvil will not create or modify world folders
- [ ] Dialog clearly states parent will create the world inside Minecraft
- [ ] Dialog clearly states existing worlds will not be altered
- [ ] Dialog requires explicit confirmation (no auto-confirm or timeouts)
- [ ] Dialog provides clear "Cancel" option
- [ ] Dialog uses calm, parent-safe language
- [ ] Modal overlay is properly styled and blocks background interaction
- [ ] Modal can be closed by clicking outside (on overlay)
- [ ] Modal can be closed by pressing Escape key

---

## Post-Confirmation Actions

- [ ] Confirming ("Open Minecraft") copies seed value to clipboard automatically
- [ ] Confirming launches Minecraft using Layer 1 launch control (same path as existing "Launch Minecraft" button)
- [ ] Instructions panel appears after successful launch (non-blocking, dismissible)
- [ ] Instructions are collapsed by default
- [ ] Instructions explain where to paste seed in Minecraft
- [ ] Instructions use calm, parent-safe language
- [ ] Instructions panel can be dismissed (closed)
- [ ] Instructions panel can be expanded/collapsed

---

## Error Handling

- [ ] If clipboard copy fails: does not block launch, proceeds to launch
- [ ] If launch fails: shows calm inline error text (no technical jargon)
- [ ] Error messages are parent-safe and actionable
- [ ] No alerts or popups beyond the modal dialog

---

## No Filesystem Writes

- [ ] No files are written to Minecraft saves directory
- [ ] No world folders are created
- [ ] No existing worlds are modified
- [ ] No partial or corrupted folders are created
- [ ] Verified by checking `.minecraft/saves` directory before and after action

---

## Launch Control

- [ ] Minecraft launches using managed instance configuration
- [ ] Launch uses correct Minecraft version (as displayed in modal)
- [ ] Launch follows Layer 1 safety guarantees
- [ ] Launch failures are handled gracefully
- [ ] Launch uses the same pathway as existing "Launch Minecraft" button

---

## Safety Guarantees

- [ ] Existing worlds are never modified
- [ ] No filesystem writes to saves directory
- [ ] No automation inside Minecraft
- [ ] No auto-switching occurs
- [ ] No child-facing UI is introduced

---

## UX Requirements

- [ ] Copy is calm and parent-safe throughout
- [ ] No pressure, urgency, or teaching language
- [ ] No excitement or encouragement language
- [ ] No "recommended for your child" language
- [ ] No technical jargon beyond necessary terms
- [ ] Confirmation is explicit and clear
- [ ] Instructions are optional (collapsed by default)

---

## Keyboard Accessibility

- [ ] Modal is keyboard accessible
- [ ] Tab key cycles through modal buttons
- [ ] Escape key closes the modal
- [ ] Enter key activates primary button when focused
- [ ] Focus is trapped within modal when open
- [ ] Buttons have clear labels for screen readers
- [ ] Modal has proper ARIA attributes (role="dialog", aria-modal="true", aria-labelledby)

---

## Technical Constraints

- [ ] Launch uses Layer 1 launch control (api.launchVanilla)
- [ ] Clipboard copy uses standard clipboard API (navigator.clipboard.writeText)
- [ ] No filesystem operations to saves directory
- [ ] No world generation or file creation
- [ ] No changes to existing world management
- [ ] No routing changes
- [ ] No new backend/IPC calls (reuses existing launchVanilla)

---

## No Persistence

- [ ] Instructions panel does not persist across app restart
- [ ] Modal state does not persist across app restart
- [ ] No state is saved to localStorage or other persistent storage
- [ ] App behaves the same after restart (instructions panel hidden)

---

## Integration with SP4.2

- [ ] "Create world" button appears only in "Curated World Seeds" section
- [ ] Button does not appear in "Curated World Example" section
- [ ] Button works with all seeds in the list
- [ ] Existing "Copy seed" functionality remains unchanged

---

## Validation Steps

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Open Home screen
   - Verify "Create world" button appears next to each seed
   - Verify button does not appear in Curated World Example section
   - Verify button styling is appropriate

2. **Modal Flow**
   - Click "Create world" on any seed
   - Verify modal opens and displays correct seed value
   - Verify modal displays correct Minecraft version
   - Verify modal text is calm and parent-safe
   - Try closing modal via Cancel button
   - Try closing modal via Escape key
   - Try closing modal by clicking outside

3. **Confirmation Flow**
   - Click "Create world" on a seed
   - Click "Open Minecraft" in modal
   - Verify seed is copied to clipboard (paste to verify)
   - Verify Minecraft launches (using same path as "Launch Minecraft" button)
   - Verify instructions panel appears after launch
   - Verify instructions are collapsed by default
   - Expand instructions and verify content

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test with clipboard permissions denied (if possible)
   - Verify launch still proceeds
   - Test with launch failure scenario
   - Verify error message is calm and parent-safe

5. **Filesystem Verification**
   - Note current state of `.minecraft/saves` directory
   - Perform "Create world" flow
   - Verify no new files or folders in saves directory
   - Verify existing worlds are unchanged

6. **Keyboard Accessibility**
   - Open modal
   - Use Tab to cycle through buttons
   - Use Escape to close
   - Use Enter when button is focused
   - Verify focus is trapped within modal

7. **Persistence Check**
   - Show instructions panel
   - Restart app
   - Verify instructions panel is not shown

---

## Expected Results

All checklist items should pass. No files should be written to the saves directory. Launch should use the same proven pathway as the existing "Launch Minecraft" button. All copy should be calm and parent-safe.

---

## Notes

- This validation should be performed on a clean Windows machine or VM
- Verify that no world files are created in `.minecraft/saves`
- Ensure existing worlds are not modified
- Test with different seeds to ensure consistency
- Verify keyboard navigation works correctly
- Check that instructions panel can be dismissed and does not persist
