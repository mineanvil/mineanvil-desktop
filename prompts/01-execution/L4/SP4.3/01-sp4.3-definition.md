## Stop Point 4.3 — Guided World Creation (Parent-Initiated)

### Definition

A parent-initiated "Create World" action provides guidance for parents to create a new Minecraft world using a known seed value. The action requires explicit confirmation, clearly states that MineAnvil will open Minecraft (but will not create or modify world folders), and provides instructions for the parent to create the world inside Minecraft using the seed. MineAnvil does not write files to the saves folder, switch worlds, or automate any actions inside Minecraft.

### Purpose

SP4.3 introduces a guided workflow that helps parents create worlds using seeds they have seen (e.g., from SP4.2). This feature:
- Allows parents to intentionally start the process of creating a world based on a seed
- Requires explicit confirmation before launching Minecraft
- Provides clear instructions for creating the world inside Minecraft
- Does not create or modify world folders
- Does not automate actions inside Minecraft
- Leverages proven launch control from Layer 1

### Why Now

SP4.1 introduced curated content conceptually. SP4.2 introduced concrete content (seeds) with a low-risk action (clipboard copy). SP4.3 provides a guided workflow that connects seeds to world creation without requiring MineAnvil to generate world files. This approach:
- Uses proven capabilities (launch control from Layer 1)
- Avoids complex world generation mechanisms
- Keeps parent in control of the actual world creation
- Maintains clear boundaries (no filesystem writes to saves/)

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

SP4.3 does NOT include:
- Creating or modifying world folders
- Writing files to the Minecraft saves directory
- Generating world files programmatically
- Headless world generation
- Auto-switching to created worlds
- Automating actions inside Minecraft
- Modifying existing worlds
- World deletion or management
- World previews or screenshots
- Multiple world creation in one action
- Batch operations
- World templates or presets beyond seed
- Server or multiplayer world creation
- Mod or datapack installation
- Schedules or automation
- Recommendations for children
- Browsing or marketplace patterns
- Child-facing UI
- World sharing or distribution
- Undo or rollback of creation
- World editing or modification
- Version migration or conversion
- World backup or restore
- World import or export

---

## UX Contract

### Action Location

The "Create World" action appears:
- On individual seed entries in the "Curated World Seeds" section (SP4.2)
- As a "Create World" button next to each seed's "Copy" button
- Only when a seed value is available

The action does NOT appear:
- On the Curated World Example section (SP4.1)
- In any menu or navigation
- On any child-facing interface
- As a bulk or batch action

### Action Initiation

1. Parent views a seed in the "Curated World Seeds" section
2. Parent clicks "Create World" button next to the seed
3. A confirmation dialog appears (see Confirmation Dialog below)
4. Parent explicitly confirms or cancels
5. If confirmed:
   - Seed is copied to clipboard (automatic)
   - Minecraft is launched (using Layer 1 launch control)
   - Instructions are shown (collapsed by default)
6. If cancelled, no action occurs

### Confirmation Dialog

The confirmation dialog must:
- Appear as a modal overlay
- Block interaction with the rest of the application until resolved
- Clearly state what will happen
- Display the seed value that will be used
- Display the Minecraft version that will be used
- Require explicit confirmation (no auto-confirm or timeouts)
- Provide a clear "Cancel" option
- Use calm, parent-safe language
- Avoid excitement or encouragement language

**Confirmation Dialog Content:**

**Title:** "Create New World"

**Body Text:**
"MineAnvil will open Minecraft. The seed [SEED_VALUE] will be copied to your clipboard. You will create the world inside Minecraft using this seed. MineAnvil will not create or modify any world folders. Existing worlds will not be altered."

**Buttons:**
- "Cancel" (primary, left)
- "Open Minecraft" (secondary, right)

### Pre-Launch Information Display

Before confirmation, the dialog must display:
- The seed value that will be used (numeric value)
- The Minecraft version that will be used (e.g., "Minecraft 1.20.1")
- A clear statement that MineAnvil will open Minecraft
- A clear statement that MineAnvil will not create or modify world folders
- A clear statement that the parent will create the world inside Minecraft
- A clear statement that existing worlds will not be altered

### Post-Launch Behaviour

After confirming and launching Minecraft:
- Seed is automatically copied to clipboard
- Minecraft launches (using Layer 1 launch control)
- A simple instruction panel appears (non-blocking, dismissible)
- Instructions are collapsed by default
- Instructions explain where to paste the seed in Minecraft's world creation screen
- MineAnvil does NOT:
  - Create or modify world folders
  - Switch to any world
  - Open Minecraft folders
  - Show world previews
  - Navigate to any other screen
  - Automate actions inside Minecraft
  - Modify existing worlds

After failed launch:
- A clear error message appears (non-blocking, dismissible)
- The message states what went wrong in plain language
- Seed may or may not be copied (implementation detail)
- Parent can retry if appropriate

### Instructions Panel

The instructions panel (collapsed by default) contains:
- **Title**: "How to create the world" (or similar calm language)
- **Content**: Simple, step-by-step instructions:
  1. In Minecraft, click "Create New World"
  2. Click "More World Options"
  3. Paste the seed value in the "Seed for the World Generator" field
  4. Click "Create New World"
- **Language**: Calm, parent-safe, no excitement or pressure
- **Collapsed by Default**: Instructions are hidden initially, parent can expand if needed
- **Dismissible**: Parent can close the panel

### Banned Elements

The "Create World" action must NOT include:
- Auto-confirmation or timeouts
- Excitement or encouragement language
- Recommendations or suggestions
- Child-facing language
- Technical jargon beyond necessary terms
- World previews or screenshots
- Multiple world creation options
- Batch operations
- Undo or rollback options
- World management features
- Links to external resources
- Automation inside Minecraft
- Filesystem writes to saves/

### Parent Control

MineAnvil guarantees:
- Parent creates the world inside Minecraft manually
- Parent controls all world creation settings
- Parent decides when to create the world
- MineAnvil does not automate any actions inside Minecraft

### Existing Worlds Protection

MineAnvil protects existing worlds by:
- Never writing to the saves directory

## Notes for Implementation Phase

When SP4.3 moves to implementation:

1. **Action Location**: Add "Create World" button in the "Curated World Seeds" section (SP4.2), next to each seed's "Copy" button.

2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Implement a modal dialog that:
   - Blocks interaction with the rest of the application
   - Displays seed value and Minecraft version
   - Clearly states MineAnvil will open Minecraft but will not create world folders
   - Clearly states parent will create the world inside Minecraft
   - Requires explicit confirmation
   - Uses calm, parent-safe language
   - Provides clear "Cancel" option

3. **Post-Confirmation Flow**:
   - Copy seed to clipboard automatically (using standard clipboard API)
   - Launch Minecraft using Layer 1 launch control (already proven)
   - Display instructions panel (non-blocking, dismissible, collapsed by default)
   - Instructions explain where to paste seed in Minecraft's world creation screen

4. **Instructions Panel**: Implement a collapsible panel that:
   - Is collapsed by default
   - Contains simple, step-by-step instructions
   - Uses calm, parent-safe language
   - Is dismissible
   - Does not block interaction with the application

5. **Validation**: Test that:
   - No files are written to Minecraft saves directory
   - No world folders are created
   - Existing worlds are never modified
   - Launch control works correctly (Layer 1)
   - Clipboard copy works correctly
   - Instructions are helpful and clear

6. **Content**: Use calm, parent-safe language throughout. Avoid excitement, pressure, or teaching language. Do not use "recommended for your child" language. Keep instructions simple and optional.
