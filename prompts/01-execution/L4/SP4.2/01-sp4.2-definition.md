# Stop Point 4.2 — Curated World Seeds (Planning Only)

**Status**: Planning phase — NO IMPLEMENTATION

This document defines Stop Point 4.2 for Layer 4 — Content Expansion.

## Stop Point 4.2 — Curated World Seeds

### Definition

A read-only "Curated World Seeds" section appears on the Home screen, allowing parents to view a small, curated list of Minecraft world seeds. Parents can optionally copy a seed value to their clipboard for manual use. The section explains that seeds are deterministic and safe, but does not create worlds, install anything, or modify Minecraft instances.

### Purpose

SP4.2 introduces parents to the concept of Minecraft world seeds through a small, curated list. This feature:
- Shows parents what world seeds are in plain language
- Demonstrates that seeds are deterministic and safe
- Allows parents to copy seed values for manual use
- Does not create or install worlds
- Does not modify Minecraft state
- Does not introduce browsing or marketplace behaviour

### Why Now

SP4.1 introduced a non-actionable example of curated content. SP4.2 introduces the first concrete content (world seeds) while maintaining strict read-only boundaries. Seeds are safe because they are just numbers that describe world generation; they do not execute code, download files, or modify existing worlds.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

SP4.2 does NOT include:
- World creation or installation
- Automatic world generation
- File writes to Minecraft directories
- World switching or activation
- Child-facing UI
- Social sharing or distribution
- Ratings, popularity, or metrics
- Images or screenshots
- Server or mod references
- Marketplace or browsing behaviour
- Persistence of copied state
- Confirmation flows or dialogs
- Parental decisions beyond copying text
- A "Worlds" menu item
- Replacement or expansion of SP4.1
- Any mutation of Minecraft state

---

## UX Contract

### Section Name
**"Curated World Seeds"** (plural)

### Location
Home screen, below the Curated World Example section (SP4.1)

### Structure
- Section title: "Curated World Seeds"
- Small curated list of seeds (recommended: 3-5 seeds)
- Each seed displays: Name, Description, Seed value
- Copy-to-clipboard button for each seed
- Collapsed explanation (default collapsed)

### Seed Display Format

Each seed in the list displays:
1. **Name**: A simple, descriptive name (e.g., "Mountain Vista")
2. **Description**: One sentence describing what makes the seed interesting in calm, parent-safe language
3. **Seed value**: The numeric seed value displayed in a copyable format

### Seed Grouping

Seeds are displayed in a simple list. No grouping, categories, or filtering is required for SP4.2.

### Copy-to-Clipboard Rules

- Each seed has a single "Copy" button
- Clicking "Copy" copies only the numeric seed value to the clipboard
- No confirmation dialog or success message is required
- Copy action does not persist any state
- Copy action does not trigger any other behaviour
- Copy action does not create or modify any files

### Explanation Behaviour

The section includes a collapsed-by-default explanation (reusing SP3.3 pattern) that:
- Uses the same toggle pattern as "What does this mean?" from Environment Status
- Explains what seeds are in plain language
- States that seeds are deterministic and safe
- Clarifies that MineAnvil does not create worlds or guarantee outcomes
- Uses calm, parent-safe language
- Contains no pressure, urgency, or teaching
- Maximum two sentences

### Banned Elements

The section must NOT include:
- Install or create buttons
- Download actions
- World previews or screenshots
- Author names or attribution
- Ratings or popularity metrics
- Dates or timestamps
- Badges or achievement indicators
- Links to external resources
- Social sharing buttons
- Any actions that mutate Minecraft state

## Safety & Determinism Notes

### Why Seeds Are Safe

World seeds are deterministic numeric values that describe how Minecraft generates a world. They:
- Do not execute code
- Do not download files
- Do not modify existing worlds
- Do not require network access
- Do not introduce security risks
- Are just numbers that parents can use manually if they choose

### Why This Does Not Mutate Minecraft

SP4.2 is read-only with one exception: copying text to the clipboard. The feature:
- Does not write files to Minecraft directories
- Does not create world files
- Does not modify instance configuration
- Does not trigger world generation
- Does not change Minecraft state in any way
- Only provides information and clipboard copy functionality

### Responsibility Boundary

MineAnvil provides seed values for informational purposes only. MineAnvil:
- Does not guarantee that a seed will produce a specific outcome
- Does not endorse or recommend any particular seed
- Does not create or install worlds
- Does not modify Minecraft behaviour
- Makes no claims about seed outcomes
- Parents use seeds at their own discretion

## Notes for Implementation Phase

When SP4.2 moves to implementation:

1. **Location**: Add the section in `src/App.tsx` within the `renderHomeContent()` function, immediately after the Curated World Example section (SP4.1).

2. **Styling**: Reuse existing card patterns from Environment Status and Curated World Example. Add minimal CSS in `src/App.css` if needed, keeping it local and subtle.

3. **Explanation Toggle**: Reuse the exact pattern from SP3.3 (explanation toggle with chevron, ARIA attributes, keyboard accessible).

4. **Copy Button**: Implement clipboard copy using the browser Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`). Handle errors gracefully without showing dialogs or confirmation messages.

5. **Seed List**: Use a small, hardcoded array of 3-5 seeds. Each seed object should have: `name`, `description`, `seedValue` (as a string or number).

6. **Content**: Use calm, parent-safe language. Avoid technical jargon except where "seed" is necessary. Do not use excitement language or recommendations.

7. **Validation**: Test that no file writes occur, no worlds are created, and no state is persisted beyond clipboard copy. Verify that viewing and copying seeds does not trigger any backend calls or IPC messages.

**Document Status**: Planning complete. Ready for review before implementation.
