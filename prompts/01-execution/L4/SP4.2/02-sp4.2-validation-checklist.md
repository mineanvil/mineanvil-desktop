---

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. Visibility Requirements

- [ ] "Curated World Seeds" section appears on Home screen below Curated World Example
- [ ] Section displays a small curated list of seeds (3-5 seeds recommended)
- [ ] Each seed displays: Name, Description, Seed value
- [ ] All content is hardcoded (no data fetching, no IPC, no backend calls)
- [ ] Section title is "Curated World Seeds" (plural)

**Verification Steps**:
1. Navigate to Home screen
2. Verify section appears immediately below Curated World Example section
3. Verify section appears before Account/Launch grid
4. Verify 3-5 seeds are displayed in a list
5. Verify each seed shows:
   - Name (calm, descriptive)
   - Description (one sentence, calm)
   - Seed value (plain text, NOT monospace/code styling)
6. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
7. Verify no network requests are made when viewing the section
8. Verify no IPC calls are made (check Electron main process logs if available)

---

### 2. Read-Only Enforcement

- [ ] No install, create, download, or activate actions possible
- [ ] No state mutation occurs when viewing the section
- [ ] No file writes to Minecraft directories
- [ ] No world creation or installation
- [ ] No trust decisions are introduced beyond copying text

**Verification Steps**:
1. Inspect all buttons and interactive elements in the section
2. Verify only "Copy seed" buttons are present (no install/create/download buttons)
3. Click "Copy seed" buttons
4. Verify only clipboard copy occurs (no file writes, no world creation)
5. Check React DevTools → verify no state changes when viewing section (except explanation toggle)
6. Verify no onClick handlers that write files or create worlds
7. Check file system → verify no writes to Minecraft directories
8. Verify no world files are created

---

### 3. Copy-to-Clipboard

- [ ] Each seed has a "Copy seed" button
- [ ] Clicking "Copy seed" copies only the numeric seed value to clipboard
- [ ] Copy action does not persist state
- [ ] Copy action does not trigger other behaviour
- [ ] Copy action does not create or modify files
- [ ] No dialog or toast shown after copy
- [ ] Clipboard errors handled silently

**Verification Steps**:
1. Click "Copy seed" button for first seed
2. Paste clipboard content (Ctrl+V in text editor)
3. Verify pasted content is exactly the numeric seed value (e.g., "1234567890")
4. Verify no additional text is copied (no name, no description)
5. Verify no dialog or toast notification appears
6. Check React DevTools → verify no state is persisted after copy
7. Restart app → verify no "copied" state persists
8. Test clipboard error handling (if possible):
   - Deny clipboard permission
   - Verify no error dialog appears
   - Verify app continues normally

7. Verify no dates (created, updated, published)
8. Verify no badges or achievement indicators
9. Verify no external links
10. Verify no social sharing buttons
11. Verify seed values use normal font (not monospace/code font)

   - Verify only one new state: `seedsExplanationExpanded` (for explanation toggle)
   - Verify no new API calls or IPC messages
   - Verify no changes to existing functions or logic
   - Verify clipboard copy uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` only
2. Check `src/App.css`:
   - Verify new CSS classes: `.seeds-list`, `.seed-item`, `.seed-name`, `.seed-description`, `.seed-value-row`, `.seed-value`, `.seed-copy-button`
   - Verify seed value uses normal font-family (inherit, not monospace)
3. Check file structure:
   - Verify no new component files created
   - Verify no new route definitions
   - Verify section is inline in `renderHomeContent()`
4. Test existing functionality:
   - Verify Environment Status still works
   - Verify Account section still works
