You are working in the MineAnvil repository (Electron + React UI).

Context
Layer 3 is unlocked.
SP3.1 (Environment Visibility) is complete.
Now begin **Stop Point 3.2 — Safety Signals**.

Stop Point 3.2 Definition:
MineAnvil surfaces clear, non-technical signals indicating whether
everything is normal, needs attention, or is unsupported.

This is still Parent UX. It must remain calm, plain-language, and state-driven.

---

Task
Implement a **Safety Signal model + UI presentation** that categorises the current state into one of:

1) Normal (All good)
2) Needs attention (Something isn’t right, but not scary)
3) Unsupported (MineAnvil cannot safely manage this environment right now)

Safety Signals must be visible to parents without requiring them to read Diagnostics.

---

Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- ❌ No repair/install/fix actions added (read-only signals only)
- ❌ No new backend calls or new IPC messages
- ❌ Do NOT expose technical details (no hashes, manifests, lockfiles, JVM arguments, etc.)
- ❌ Do NOT require users to understand what Java is
- ❌ Do NOT change existing behaviour or workflows
- ❌ Do NOT implement escalation paths (that is SP3.4)
- ✅ You MAY reuse existing app state already available in the renderer
- ✅ You MAY refactor UI code to support clean state mapping

---

Signal Inputs (Allowed)
Derive the signal from existing, already-known states, such as:
- Signed-in status / authentication state
- Ownership status
- Minecraft readiness status (“ready to play” vs not ready)
- Known fatal error states already surfaced (startup failure, install failure)
- Any existing “unsupported/unverified app” / blocked states already represented

Do NOT fetch new information.

---

Required Output UX

A) Home page Safety Signal (primary)
The “Environment Status” card must show a single clear signal:
- A short title (one line)
- A short explanation (one line)
- Optional “Last checked” style text ONLY if already available without new calls

Examples (use your judgement; keep it calm):
Normal:
- Title: “Everything looks good”
- Body: “Minecraft is ready and managed by MineAnvil.”

Needs attention:
- Title: “Action needed”
- Body: “MineAnvil can’t start Minecraft yet.”

Unsupported:
- Title: “Not supported right now”
- Body: “MineAnvil can’t safely manage this setup.”

B) Visual difference
Make the three states visually distinct (subtle, not alarming).
Use consistent styling patterns (badge/stripe/icon).
No flashing, no aggressive warning design.

C) No extra controls
The card must remain read-only.
No “Fix now”, no “Install”, no “Open diagnostics” added here.
(Existing navigation remains available via sidebar.)

---

Implementation Guidance
1) Introduce a small pure function (or module) that maps existing UI state -> SafetySignal:
   type SafetySignal = "normal" | "attention" | "unsupported"
   Provide a single source of truth for this mapping.

2) Update the Home Environment Status card to render copy based on SafetySignal.

3) Keep copy parent-safe and non-technical.
Prefer: “MineAnvil can’t start Minecraft yet”
Avoid: “Runtime missing” / “Lockfile mismatch” / “Auth token expired”

---

Validation Checklist
- Home page shows exactly one of the three signals at all times
- Parents can understand the signal without technical knowledge
- No new controls added to resolve issues
- No new backend calls or IPC messages
- No behavioural changes to existing flows
- Signal mapping is centralised and testable
