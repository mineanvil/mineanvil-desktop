You are working in the MineAnvil repository (Electron + React UI).

We are implementing **Stop Point 3.3 — Explain Without Teaching**.

SP3.1 and SP3.2 are complete.
SafetySignal mapping logic is frozen and must not be changed.

---

Stop Point 3.3 Definition
Parents can optionally learn why something matters through calm,
plain-language explanations without being required to understand technical details.

---

Task (Minimal Implementation)
Add OPTIONAL, COLLAPSED-BY-DEFAULT explanations to the Home page
Environment Status card for each SafetySignal state:
- normal
- attention
- unsupported

Explanations must be:
- opt-in (user clicks)
- collapsed by default
- read-only
- max two sentences each
- no jargon
- no instructions

---

Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- ❌ Do NOT change SafetySignal mapping logic or inputs
- ❌ Do NOT add new backend calls or IPC
- ❌ Do NOT add actions/buttons/links that tell users what to do
- ❌ Do NOT mention technical terms: Java, runtime, lockfile, manifest, UUID, tokens
- ❌ Do NOT add “Open diagnostics”, “Fix now”, “Reinstall”, or similar
- ❌ Do NOT add modals; keep the disclosure inline

---

UI Pattern
Add a small link under the existing status text:
- Label: “What does this mean?”
- Clicking toggles an inline expanded panel containing the explanation text.

The link must:
- be subtle (secondary)
- not visually noisy
- be accessible (keyboard focusable)

Copy (authoritative, do not reword)

For SafetySignal = "normal":
  “MineAnvil checks your account and keeps Minecraft in a known-good state.
   If something changes, you’ll see it here.”

For SafetySignal = "attention":
  “MineAnvil needs one step before Minecraft can start.
   This is usually quick, and you won’t break anything by waiting.”

For SafetySignal = "unsupported":
  “MineAnvil can’t safely manage this setup right now.
   This usually means the account isn’t eligible or access is blocked.”

---

Validation Checklist
- Explanations are collapsed by default
- Toggle works and does not change any app behaviour
- SafetySignal logic is unchanged
- No new actions or guidance introduced
- No technical jargon introduced
- Copy is exactly as provided
- Only applied to the Home Environment Status card (one surface only)
