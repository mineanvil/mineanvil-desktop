You are working in the MineAnvil repository (Electron + React UI).

Context
Layer 2 is complete through SP2.4.
We are beginning Layer 3 — Parent UX.

This task implements **Stop Point 3.1 — Environment Visibility** only.

---

Stop Point 3.1 — Environment Visibility

Definition:
Parents can see the high-level state of the Minecraft environment
(version status, health, control) in plain language.
No mutation or configuration is possible.

---

Task
Add a **read-only environment visibility surface** that clearly communicates
the current state of the Minecraft environment to a parent user.

---

Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- ❌ Read-only only — no actions, buttons, or controls that mutate state
- ❌ Do NOT reuse Diagnostics UI or expose technical details
- ❌ Do NOT add repair, install, retry, or fix actions
- ❌ Do NOT introduce new backend calls or IPC messages
- ❌ Do NOT change existing behaviour or logic
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate existing status information in multiple places

---

Allowed Data Sources
You may reuse existing state already available in the UI, such as:
- Minecraft readiness / launch readiness
- Ownership state
- Version label already displayed (e.g. “latest”)

Do NOT fetch new data.

---

UX Requirements
- Plain language
- Calm tone
- High-level summary only
- Parent can understand it at a glance
- No obligation to act

Example wording (illustrative only):
- “Minecraft is ready and managed by MineAnvil.”
- “Everything looks good.”

Do not invent warnings or error states.

---

Placement
Choose ONE location only:
- Home page, near the top
OR
- Minecraft page, above primary actions

Do not add it to both.

---

Validation Checklist
- Parent can answer “Is everything OK?” without scrolling
- No controls allow changing anything
- No technical terminology is visible
- No existing behaviour changed
- SP3.1 definition is satisfied and nothing else is advanced
